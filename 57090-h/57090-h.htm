<h2 id="CONSTITUTION_OF_THE_PENNSYLVANIA_PRISON_SOCIETY">CONSTITUTION OF THE PENNSYLVANIA PRISON SOCIETY.</h2>

<p>When we consider that the obligations of benevolence, which are
founded on the precepts and example of the Author of Christianity, are
not canceled by the follies or crimes of our fellow-creatures, and when
we reflect upon the miseries which penury, hunger, cold, unnecessary
severity, unwholesome apartments, and guilt (the usual attendants of
prisons) involve with them, it becomes us to extend our compassions to
that part of mankind who are the subjects of those miseries. By the aid
of humanity their undue and illegal sufferings may be prevented; the link
which should bind the whole family of mankind together under all circumstances,
be preserved unbroken; and such degree and modes of punishment
may be discovered and suggested as may, instead of continuing
habits of vice, become the means of restoring our fellow-creatures to
virtue and happiness. From a conviction of the truth and obligations of
these principles, the subscribers have associated themselves under the
title of “<span class="smcap">The Pennsylvania Prison Society</span>.”</p>

<p>For effecting these purposes they have adopted the following Constitution:</p>

<h3>ARTICLE I.</h3>

<p>The officers of the Society shall consist of a President, two Vice-Presidents,
two Secretaries, a Treasurer (who may be an undoubted
first-class Trust and Safe Deposit Company regularly chartered by the
State or National Authorities), and two Counselors.</p>

<p>The Committee on Membership in the “Acting Committee” shall
be the nominating committee of the Society, whose duty it shall be
after careful consideration to nominate members of the Society most
suitable in their judgment for the above named offices. The officers
and the Acting Committee shall be chosen by ballot, at the Annual
Meeting of the Society, which shall be on the fourth Thursday in the
First month (January) of each year and they shall continue in office
until their successors are elected. A majority of the whole number of
votes cast shall be necessary to the choice of any nominee for office.</p>

<p>In case an election for any cause shall not be held at the time above
mentioned, it shall be the duty of the President to call a Special Meeting
of the Society, within thirty days for the purpose of holding such election,
of which at least three days’ notice shall be given.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE II.</h3>

<p>The President shall preside in all meetings, and subscribe all public
acts of the Society. He may call special meetings whenever he may
deem it expedient, and shall do so when requested in writing by five members.
In his absence one of the Vice-Presidents may act in his place.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE III.</h3>

<p>The Secretaries shall keep fair records of the proceedings of the
Society, and shall conduct its correspondence.</p>

<h3>ARTICLE IV.</h3>

<p>The Treasurer shall pay all orders of the Society or of the Acting
Committee, signed by the presiding officer and the Secretary, and shall
present a statement of the receipts and expenditures at each stated meeting
of the Society, and an annual report at the annual meeting in the
First month (January).</p>

<p>All capital moneys, investments, securities and property belonging to
the Society may be placed in the care and custody of such trust company
as the Society may by resolution direct, for safe keeping and for the collection
of the income and principal thereof.</p>

<p>All investments and re-investments of capital money shall be made
by direction of at least three members of the Finance Committee of the
Society.</p>

<p>All bequests and life subscriptions which may be received shall be
safely invested, the income only thereupon to be applied to the current
expenses of the Society.</p>

<span class="medium">ANNUAL REPORT OF JOHN J. LYTLE, GENERAL SECRETARY</span></h2>

<p>In submitting this, my Seventeenth Annual Report, it is
with renewed feelings of devout thankfulness to my Heavenly
Father that He has spared my life through another year, and
given me the health and strength to perform a service so near
and dear to my heart.</p>

<p>In one respect the work of the Pennsylvania Prison
Society is unique. Besides the General Secretary, whose
labors are confined chiefly to the Eastern Penitentiary, and
the Agent for the County Prison, the Society has an “Acting
Committee” of fifty members, who by two legislative enactments
have the rights of official visitors. The first of these
acts became operative in 1829. This was supplemented by the
act approved March 20, 1903, which is as follows:</p>

<h3>AN ACT</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>To make active or visiting committees, of societies incorporated
for the purpose of visiting and instructing prisoners,
official visitors of penal and reformatory institutions.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Section I.</span> Be it enacted, etc., That the active or visiting
committee of any society heretofore incorporated and now
existing in this Commonwealth for the purpose of visiting
and instructing prisoners, or persons confined in any penal or
reformatory institution, and alleviating their miseries, shall be
and are hereby made official visitors of any jail, penitentiary,
or other penal or reformatory institution in this Commonwealth,
maintained at the public expense, with the same powers,
privileges, and functions as are vested in the official visitors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of prisons and penitentiaries, as now prescribed by law: Provided,
That no active or visiting committee of any such society
shall be entitled to visit such jails or penal institutions, under
this act, unless notice of the names of the members of such
committee, and the terms of their appointment, is given by
such society, in writing, under its corporate seal, to the warden,
superintendent or other officer in charge of such jail, or other
officer in charge of any such jail or other penal institution.</p>

<p>Approved&mdash;The 20th day of March, A. D. 1903.</p>

<p class="author">
<span class="smcap">Saml. W. Pennypacker.</span><br />
</p>

<p>The foregoing is a true and correct copy of the Act of the
General Assembly No. 48.</p>

<h3>THE EASTERN PENITENTIARY</h3>

<p>Under the rights thus conferred those members of the
Acting Committee of the Pennsylvania Prison Society assigned
to the Eastern Penitentiary visit prisoners in their cells. It
is found that this personal work of Christian men and women
is productive of good results. In the privacy of the cell hearts
and lives are laid open, impressions are made, resolutions are
formed, and changes are brought about that under a less personal
and individual system of treatment would be well-nigh
impossible. The corridor for female prisoners is in charge of a
matron, and is regularly visited by women members of the
Acting Committee.</p>

<p>During the past year I made over three hundred visits to
the Penitentiary; and have had more than three thousand personal
interviews with men. Those who need it receive a complete
outfit of new clothing on their discharge. But looking after
the physical well-being of a man when he leaves I regard as
the least important of my duties. I ascertain what his past
has been, what his prospects are for the future, and in what
way he can be aided in carrying out the good resolutions he
may have formed. Thus with good advice and helpful service
the man is again given an opportunity to rehabilitate himself.</p>

<p>Besides caring for those just discharged, the General Secretary
and the Agent of the County Prison also extend aid to
men who have been released for some time, but who have
failed to secure employment. This is done at the relief station
maintained near the Penitentiary, which is open every morning.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Here men who are found to be really deserving are
supplied with meal tickets, lodging-room rent, and goods to
sell.</p>

<p>The total amount expended during the past year from
the Fund for Discharged Prisoners was $3,795.56. Tools were
given to men to the amount of $69.16.</p>

<p>As heretofore, Divine services were held in the different
corridors each First Day morning under the direction of the
Moral Instructor, the Rev. Joseph Welsh. The speakers were
supplied by the Local Preachers’ Association of the Methodist
Episcopal Church, the Protestant Episcopal City Mission, and
the Lutheran City Mission.</p>

<p>The Sunday Song Services at 4 <small>P. M.</small> by choirs from
different churches, arranged for by the Rev. H. L. Duhring,
D. D., Superintendent of the Protestant Episcopal City Mission,
were continued during the year.</p>

<p>I am greatly indebted to all the officers and overseers of
the Penitentiary for their uniform courtesy and their valuable
assistance in the prosecution of my work. Charles C. Church
has proved himself to be an able and efficient warden, to whose
administrative ability and genial manner the discipline and
good order of the institution are chiefly due.</p>

<h3>THE PHILADELPHIA COUNTY PRISON</h3>

<p>This Prison still keeps up its record as a well managed
institution. Unfortunately, the Convict Department at Holmesburg
is somewhat overcrowded, and it is to be regretted that
funds have not yet been provided by the City Councils for additional
corridors, so that each man could be separately confined
as the law provides. It is admitted by the advocates
both of the separate and of the congregate system, that those
awaiting trial should be strictly separated. To place a first,
and especially a young offender, with a hardened criminal,
simply means the production of another criminal, and places
the State itself in the position of committing a wrong against
one of its own citizens.</p>

<p>Frederick J. Pooley, one of the Secretaries of the Society
and Agent at the County Prison, is more untiring
than ever in his efforts for the betterment of those incarcerated
in Moyamensing, at Tenth and Reed Streets, and in the New
County Jail (Convict Department), at Holmesburg. He visits
both institutions during five days in the week, seeks to aid
men temporally and morally, is instrumental in having cases
brought to speedy trial, and in some cases even looks after
the destitute families of prisoners. At Moyamensing, women
members of the Acting Committee also visit in the Women’s
Department.</p>

Prison, Tenth and Reed Streets:</p>

<h3>THE ASSOCIATED COMMITTEE OF WOMEN ON POLICE MATRONS</h3>

<p>The Associated Committee of Women on Police Matrons
in Station Houses meets monthly with three representatives
from each of a number of the charitable associations of Philadelphia.
On this Committee, the Pennsylvania Prison Society
is represented by Mrs. P. W. Lawrence, Dr. Emily J. Ingram
and Mary S. Wetherell. The following is the report of the
Committee for the past year:</p>

<p>The Committee on Police Matrons held ten regular and
one special meeting during the year ending December 31,
1906.</p>

<p>The membership of this Committee is now twenty-one
women who represent seven societies, namely, the Pennsylvania
Prison Society, Women’s Christian Temperance Union,
Civic Club, New Century Club, Young Women’s Christian
Association, Christian League, and Mothers’ Club. The usual
attendance is from eight to twelve members. Reports are
received from all the Matrons at each meeting. There are
twenty-two. The fourteenth district (Germantown) was
supplied with a Matron in March, 1906. The effort is made
that each Matron shall receive at least one visit a month. The
meeting of the Conference of Charities in Philadelphia in
May last brought us unusual interest in the work of Police
Matrons elsewhere, and we formed a permanent committee
to secure knowledge of it in other cities, and comparison of
methods with them. At several meetings of this year, four
Matrons at a time were invited to meet with the Committee,
and offer suggestions and state experiences requiring help
and study. The Needle Work Guild coöperates with the Committee
for supplying clothing to the Matrons for their use
with needy women and children under their care. Mrs.
Fletcher, our Senior Matron, completed her twentieth year
of service, and was given a reception by the Committee, at
which the Directors and other officials were present. In this
time she has had 9,000 women and 2,900 children under her
care. The Director of Public Safety, Robert McKenty, has
been especially interested in an effort to give personal help to
erring women and girls, and extends every facility for our communication
with such, by directing the Lieutenants to coöperate
with our efforts to redeem them from disgrace and despair.
The numbers given in our reports are, of course, from twenty-two
districts only. There are fourteen others without Matrons,
where many women and children are received. We have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
assured that a Matron will be appointed in West Philadelphia
very soon, and there is also a prospect of more effective systematic
work in coöperation and supervision of this branch of
police administration.</p>

<h4>CHESTER COUNTY PRISON</h4>

<p>William Scattergood, President of the Board of Inspectors,
makes weekly visits to this prison, and reports it
in good condition. It is considered a model prison. Deborah
C. Leeds, a member of the Acting Committee, has also visited
it during the year.</p>

<h4>COUNTY PRISON AT MEDIA</h4>

<p>Deborah C. Leeds has visited this prison several times
during the year, and reports it a well conducted institution.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span></p>

<h4>ALLEGHENY COUNTY</h4>

<p>Mrs. E. W. Gormley, Superintendent of the Prison and
Jail Department of the W. C. T. U., is also a member of the
Acting Committee of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, and as
such an official visitor to the penitentiaries, county jails and
reformatories of the Commonwealth. We are highly favored
in having a member who is doing efficient work in the western
part of the State.</p>

<h4>DOOR OF BLESSING</h4>

<p>This institution for discharged female prisoners was established
and is under the supervision of Mrs. Horace Fassett,
who is an official visitor at the Eastern Penitentiary and the
County Prison. She writes: “The Door of Blessing goes
steadily on in its good work under its noble matron, Gertrude
Brown. Since January, 1906, fifty women and four babies
were sent there from our County Prison, the House of
Correction, and the Eastern Penitentiary. All of these were
placed in situations in the country, mostly on farms. Some have
returned to go to better positions, some have remained, and very
few have gone back to their old life. The Door of Blessing
is a home for these dear children in every sense of the word&mdash;a
haven of rest and peace. All love it and look forward to
their afternoons out, that they may go there and have supper
with the matron and tell her of their joys and sorrows, to which
she listens with loving sympathy. Six women were sent to their
homes, their families being willing to receive them after a short
stay at the Door of Blessing.”</p>

<h4>HOME OF INDUSTRY</h4>

<p>This institution extends help to men discharged from the
Eastern Penitentiary and the County Prison. It provides board
and shelter for these, gives them employment in broom-making,
for which they receive compensation, and seeks to bring all who
enter it under the saving power of the Gospel. The efficient
Superintendent is Frank H. Starr, who makes every effort
to place men in situations when they leave the Home.</p>

<h4>GALILEE MISSION</h4>

<p>This is under the care of the Protestant Episcopal Church.
A large number of men from the Penitentiary and County
Prison have been sent there for meals and lodgings, sometimes
only for a few days, and at other times for a week or two until
they could obtain work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

<h4>HOPE HALL, NEW YORK. UNDER THE CARE OF MRS. BALLINGTON
BOOTH</h4>

<p>During the year a number of men have been sent to this
place from the Eastern Penitentiary. Mrs. Booth always receives
such with a warm welcome, and often obtains good
situations for them.</p>

<h4>PRISON SUNDAY</h4>

<p>In the early part of October, 1906, the Committee on
Prison Sunday sent out a circular letter, urging the observance
of October 21st as Prison Sunday, to thirty-three hundred
ministers of the Methodist Episcopal, the Presbyterian, the
Baptist, the Lutheran, the Protestant Episcopal, and the Reformed
Churches in Pennsylvania, and to six hundred daily
and weekly newspapers.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">From the Minutes</span><br />

MEMORIALS OF DECEASED MEMBERS</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">George W. Hall</span></h4>

<p>George W. Hall, former member of the State Legislature and of City
Councils, a well-known financier, and President of the Pennsylvania
Prison Society, passed away on December 14, 1906, in the 77th year of
his age. He was a member of the Franklin Institute, a director of the
School of Design for Women, a director of the Home for Feeble
Minded Children at Elwyn, a member of the St. Andrew’s Society, a
trustee of the Second Presbyterian Church, and an inspector of the
Philadelphia County Prison.</p>

<p>It seems proper that there should be a minute of record of one who
for years has been an active member, besides being a life member of the
Society. He spent much time in looking after the welfare of the prisoners
at the County Prison, Tenth and Reed Streets, and at Holmesburg,
where he will be greatly missed.</p>

<p>May this minute be recorded and a copy sent to the surviving members
of his family.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Rev. James Roberts, D. D.</span></h4>

<p>Rev. James Roberts, D. D., was born at Montrose, Scotland, December
25, 1839.</p>

<p>He came to this country with his parents at an early age, and was
graduated from the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1868. His first
charge was at Coatesville, Pa., where he remained until 1885, when he
took charge of the Church at Darby, Pa. After remaining there ten
years he accepted a call to Lambertville, N. J. On leaving this charge
he became Superintendent of the Mercer Home for Aged and Retired
Ministers, which position he filled until called suddenly from earth on
September 27, 1906. His genial, affectionate ways widened the circle of
his friends, who were found among all classes. It is with sincere sorrow
that our Society records the departure of another of its most honored
members and Second Vice-President.</p>

<p>Resolved, That this minute be entered on our records and a copy
thereof with our sympathies be sent to the bereaved family.</p></blockquote>

Prison Society may constantly widen its scope of operations
and grow in efficiency and usefulness as it grows in years.</p>

<p>The work I have performed during not only the last, but
for many years, has been very dear to my heart, and I have
felt that I have had an especial call to the service. Conscious,
however, of my need continually of Divine guidance in all
that I have done in His name, I have earnestly sought for
that wisdom which will enable me to do all for Him.</p>

<p>With sincere desire that I may be a humble instrument
in His hands in winning souls unto Christ, this report is
respectfully submitted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Joshua L. Baily was elected President of The Pennsylvania
Prison Society at the annual meeting, January, 1907. His
membership in the Society dates from 1851 and he is the
oldest member now living. For a number of years he was a
member of the Acting Committee and a regular visitor of
the Eastern Penitentiary. His great interest in prison discipline
induced him, some years ago, to visit voluntarily all
the penitentiaries in the Atlantic States, as well as some of
those in the States of the Central West, and he visited also
many of the County Prisons in Pennsylvania and other States.
His interest in correctional institutions was further shown by
ten years’ service on the Board of Managers of the House
of Refuge.</p>

<p>Mr. Baily has been no less actively interested in charitable
institutions, having been for more than fifty years a manager
of The Philadelphia Society for the Employment and Instruction
of the Poor, of which he is now President. He was
one of the founders, and for eighteen years the President of
The Philadelphia Society for Organizing Charity. He is
also a member and manager of a number of other benevolent
societies, so that by reason of long experience, in both correctional
and charitable service, Mr. Baily comes to the Presidency
of the Prison Society well equipped for the duties
devolving upon him. Although still engaged in mercantile business,
Mr. Baily gives a large portion of his time, as well as his
means, to benevolent purposes, and devotes thereto a degree
of vigor, both mental and physical, quite unusual in one of
his advanced years.

<h3 id="THE_NATIONAL_PRISON_CONGRESS">THE NATIONAL PRISON CONGRESS</h3>

<h4><span class="smcap">Albany, New York, September</span>, 15-20, 1906.</h4>

<p>The National Prison Association met in its annual Congress,
in the Senate Chamber of the State Capitol, at Albany,
N. Y., on the evening of September 15, 1906. The meeting was
called to order by the Chairman of the Local Committee, Mr.
James F. McElroy, and prayer was offered by the Rev. W. F.
Wittaker, D. D., pastor of the First Presbyterian Church.</p>

<p>The Hon. Julius E. Mayer, Attorney-General, represented
the Governor in the address of welcome in behalf of the State,
and the Mayor of Albany, the Hon. Charles H. Gans, spoke
for the city. The Rev. Dr. Frederick Howard Wines made the
response, in which he dwelt in reminiscent vein on some of his
experiences since the first meeting of the Association, and spoke
especially of the leading men who were connected with it during
its early history. Dr. Wines advocated three reforms: 1, the
abolition of the “sweating” or “third-degree” system, which he
called an outrage on the rights of prisoners; 2, the reorganization
of the jury system, so that juries could no longer be selected
by the “Gang” for the express purpose of defeating justice; and
3, the dismissing of small misdemeanants on their own recognizance,
instead of crowding the jails with these.</p>

<p>Dr. Wines then introduced the President of the Association,
the Hon. Cornelius V. Collins, Superintendent of Prisons
of New York State.</p>

<h3>PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS</h3>

<p>Mr. Collins, after alluding briefly to the purposes and work
of the Association, rehearsed the part his own State had taken
in the development of plans for the scientific treatment of criminals.
Having traced the successive steps in prison reform, in
which he showed that New York State had taken the lead, he
said:</p>

<p>“Public sentiment has always called for the education and
training of the young. How much more important and of
what inestimable value is the saving of the adult. Situated as
we are here, at the gateway of the republic, we admit at Ellis
Island more than a million new people each year. Vital statistics
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
in New York City gave 59,000 births last year, only 11,000
of which were of American parentage. Austria, Russia and
Italy each sent us 200,000 immigrants last year. What is more
natural than that many of them, wholly unacquainted with our
country, our language and our laws, should in their first effort
at living in the land of liberty run counter to our laws and find
their way to prison. Surely they do come, and the number is
constantly increasing. There are now 12,000 convicts in the
prisons of this State, made up largely from this cosmopolitan
army of ignorance and superstition. This is the problem we
have to solve in New York State, and while it is no doubt a fact
that our State will always have more than others, it is nevertheless
true that every State in the Union will have this class of
prisoners to deal with in increasing numbers as time goes on.”</p>

<p>Superintendent Collins detailed the good that followed the
separation and classification of prison inmates into groups or
grades and the training of the mental faculties through the plan
of education in vogue in New York State prisons. The labor
and industrial training provided in connection with mental
training was spoken of and a plea was made for the indeterminate
sentence. In conclusion Superintendent Collins made a
timely argument in favor of a reform in county jails. In
this connection he said:</p>

<p>“We who are familiar with the facts know that many convicts
are received at the prisons who are morally poisoned and
contaminated while awaiting trial in the jails by the intimate
association with confirmed and degraded criminals which is
permitted in these institutions. This is especially true of the
younger class of offenders, who come to the jail having respect
for authority and dread of confinement. At no period of their
penal term are they so susceptible to external influences. If
at this period a practical reformatory influence is exerted upon
them, their correction can in most cases be accomplished, but if
they are left in idleness and subject to the evil influences of
degraded companions their respect for law is soon destroyed,
and they become hardened and defiant and accept the theories
and ambitions of the confirmed criminals as their own. Thus
the man who enters jail in such condition that proper treatment
would readily turn him from his criminal course often reaches
the prison a most discouraging subject for its reformatory
system.</p>

<p>“For the interest of society, as well as the protection of
young offenders, the jail system should be corrected. The jail
buildings are improved and the prisoners are better fed than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
they were fifty years ago; otherwise the system remains practically
the same. Its conspicuous defects still exist. No chain
is stronger than its weakest link; the extensive schemes of penal
administration in the several States have their fatally weak part
in their jails. Genuine and effective organization in the United
States for the salvation of criminals and alleged criminals must
take heed of these facts, which are notorious.</p>

<p>“May I now suggest that a committee, to be called, if you
please, the Committee on Plan and Scope, be appointed at this
session of the Prison Congress to consider the following recommendations:</p>

<p>“First. A rational and uniform system of jail administration.</p>

<p>“Second. A uniform system of education for prison
officers.</p>

<p>“Third. A uniform system of education for convicts.</p>

<p>“Fourth. So far as possible, a uniform system of prison
discipline.</p>

<p>“Fifth. A uniform system of classification.</p>

<p>“Sixth. A uniform system of parole, and a careful consideration
of all other matters that in their judgment would
tend to make further reforms in the treatment of the criminal
classes.</p>

<p>“This committee to make a report of their conclusions at
the session of 1907.”</p>

<p>The Congress, deeply impressed by Mr. Collins’ recommendations,
subsequently appointed a strong committee to report
at the next meeting on the jail system in the United States.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Sunday, September 16th</span></h3>

<h4>MORNING</h4>

<p>The Conference Sermon was preached by the Rt. Rev.
William Crosswell Doane, D. D., LL. D., Bishop of the
Diocese of Albany, in the Cathedral of All Saints, where the
delegates attended in a body. The Bishop’s text was Matt.
25:36, “I was in prison and ye came unto me.” He said in
part: “Almost by an instinctive impulse these words come
first to the mind of the preacher at such a service, and by a
striking and happy coincidence this service falls upon the Sunday
when our Book of Common Prayer appoints for the second
morning lesson the chapter which ends with this intense
expression of our Lord, containing, I think, the seed principle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
upon which the noble work of this Association was founded
and has been carried on. Last year the preacher took the
earthly ministry of our dear divine Lord as the pattern of
this work, ‘Who went about doing good.’</p>

<p>“I am only supplementing and carrying along the line
of his thought when I ask you to think of the divine Master
as giving not the pattern only, but the principle of your work.
There is no contradiction in the double presentation of our
Lord’s personality along this as along so many other lines.
He is so essentially by His incarnation in our human nature
that we bring Him to those to whom we minister in His name
and find Him in those to whom we bring Him. And in
either of these sides the truth is set forth and enforced that
the object of all Christian service, whether it be the work of
Christianity in religious teaching, or the work of Christianity
in the administration of civic affairs, is not the violent
denunciation or vindictive infliction of punishment upon a
sinner, but the offer of help and the opportunity of reform.
The Prison Reform Association may well claim that it describes
and expresses in its name the purpose for which in
Christian lands prisons exist. ‘He came not to condemn the
world, but to save it.’ ‘The Son of Man has come to seek
and save the lost.’</p>

<p>“Curiously enough, whatever technical differences may lie
in the use of the various words prison and gaol and reformatory,
there is one that stands out as having in its root
meaning the very thought of that on which we are dwelling,
because the penitentiary is certainly the place where men are
led and drawn, through real penitence, to seek and find pardon
and peace.</p>

<p>“I am not losing sight of the purpose of imprisonment
both to stamp crime as crime and to protect society from the
criminal. I am only advocating the thought of reform for
which this Association stands. If a man is a murderer condemned
to die, then there is the overwhelming duty and responsibility
of bringing him to repentance, that he may die
forgiven. If he is serving a sentence indeterminate or for
a fixed time, then surely the influence and effort of prison discipline
must be not to harden him into sullen hatred of law
and of all that the law stands for, not in a harbored purpose
to revenge himself in some way, when once he is free, upon
the society which has condemned him; but to waken in him
such a sense of shame as shall force him back to the possibility
of self-respect, and bring him to that point of realized
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
wrong by means of which he shall ‘come to himself.’ That
is the Master’s own description of the prodigal son. Far as
he had strayed from his father’s house, he had strayed farther
from his real self, the self of his innocent childhood, the self
of his home and surroundings, the self of his true nature,
and it was when the true man wakened in him that, coming
first to himself, he came next to his father’s house.</p>

<p>“In this recognition of the criminal’s sin there must be
enforced the discipline of penalty, and of penalty as punishment,
but it must be carefully dealt with, so as in no sense to
convey the thought of retribution or of vindictive retaliation.
The strides of progress which have been made in the last
century and a half under the methods of such real reformers
as Howard and Wines (whom, as a boy, I remember very
well), and Elizabeth Fry and Dorothy Dix, have, among
other things, set the stamp of this idea in the fact that capital
punishment, which used to be inflicted for many crimes, is
reserved to the one for which it was divinely ordered, and
from which, I trust, it will never be taken away, namely, the
sin of shedding another’s blood. Meanwhile, more and more,
in the selection of wardens, in the appointment of chaplains,
in the abolition of the fearful cruelties of physical torture,
in the decent sanitation of prisons, we have grown more and
more to realize that the condemned criminal is to be treated
as a man who needs protection, systematic discipline, the training
of the prison, to protect him from himself, to put into him
the purpose and set before him the possibility of a better life,
rather than to humiliate and crush him into desperation and
despair. It is quite true that no amount of legislation and
no method of enforcing laws can make a man moral, but it
is also true that the law which defines and punishes sin deters
men from the commission of crime, and when the criminal
is condemned and sentenced and his punishment begins, only
the power of religion can reach him to convince him of his
sin, to convert him from his habits, to reach the motives of
his life, to change the tendency of his will, to form in him
new habits, to give him the spiritual help by which his conscience
may be enlightened and his character changed.</p>

<p>“And there are certain human, natural, physical reasons
for the right attitude to the convicted criminal which more
than warrant us in assuming it as the groundwork and motive
of our dealings with him. It is told, I think of an English
bishop, seeing a criminal drawn in a tumbril to execution on
Ludgate Hill, in London, that he said, ‘There go I but for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
grace.’ Somehow I know it is true that now and then men
whose lives have been surrounded from childhood up to the
very moment of their fall with the best influences, suddenly
lapse into great sin. We have instances in the last year which
have startled and staggered communities, men in places of
trust who have betrayed it, and have either been flung down
from the position of confidence and honor or fallen themselves,
and found in flight or in suicide the fatal termination
of what has seemed to be a career of honorable service. I am
bound to say a word even for these. I believe the vindictive
personalities which have assailed some of these men are in
some cases absolutely unjust.</p>

<p>“There ought to be, thank God, there is, more and more in
the great movements in our cities, a strong, set effort of prevention,
which is far better than cure. The prisons will be
emptier when we have reached the root and reason of crime.
If we can control the use of liquor and stop at least its excess;
if we can stamp out the curse of drunkenness; if we can
more and more arrest the degradation of our slums; if we
can train up a race of children in surroundings of physical
healthfulness, of moral decency and dignity; and still better,
if we can instil into them from earliest childhood the principles
and pattern of Jesus Christ, we shall have begun, at
the right end, the restoration and the reformation of humanity.
Meanwhile, until all these movements have ripened into
some result, it becomes us to remember from what sources
and in what surroundings the grown-up criminal has come;
to realize how far we, by our neglect and indifference, have
been responsible for them; and to reach out the helping hand
of deep sympathy and pity in the effort to reclaim, to restore
and to reform.</p>

<p>“The great revealed truth of universal redemption is full
of grace and help. Still more, the truth of individual indwelling
of the Christ in us, the hope of glory. It is true that
in a way this is a doctrine, a dogma, as people say who think
of a dogma as a tyrannical imposition upon their intellectual
liberty; but it is truer still that, like many another thing which
we call dogma, it is a fact on which depends not merely our
holding right faith in Jesus Christ as the God-man, but on
which also depend the method and the hope and the value of
our dealing with humanity at large or with the individual
man. It has in it besides the very highest human hope possible
for you and me, that in the great day of eternal decision
there shall be for us who have recognized Jesus in those to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
whom we ministered here the full revelation and manifestation
of His glorious God-head, with the word of ‘well done’ and
welcome into ‘the kingdom prepared for us from the foundation
of the world.’”</p>

<h4>EVENING</h4>

<p>At many churches of the city various phases of the work
of the Association were presented by delegates to the Congress.
At the Cathedral Mr. Thomas M. Osborne, President
of the George Junior Republic, Auburn, N. Y., spoke on “The
True Foundations of Prison Reform”; Mr. George B. Wellington,
of Troy, on “The Duty That We Owe the Convict”;
and Prof. Henderson, of Chicago, on “Preventive Work with
Children.” The latter maintained that the proper training
of a child to keep it from becoming a criminal began before
it was born. Crime was not a heritage, but criminal tendencies
sometimes were. Judge Lindsay, the great enthusiast in
behalf of children, had said that the Juvenile court was
organized to keep children out of jail, but that now the problem
was to keep children out of the Juvenile court. The
problem is to get back to childhood, back to infancy. Babyhood
determined whether there should be a large or a small
criminal class. Place the child from earliest infancy into such
a physical environment and under such mental and spiritual
influences as will produce the habit of right living.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Monday, September 17</span></h3>

<h4>MORNING</h4>

<p>The meeting was called to order by President Collins and
opened with prayer by the Rev. Thomas D. Anderson. After
the appointment of committees and other routine business, the
Wardens’ Association went into session. In the absence of
the President, Mr. N. N. Jones, Iowa State Prison, Fort
Madison, his address was read by Mr. Frank L. Randall,
Minnesota, who had been called to the chair. The paper was
a compact statement of the warden’s relation to current prison
reform. With reference to prison labor it showed how small
a portion of the total product is contributed by prisoners.
Regarding the relation of discipline to reformation, the writer
said: “Discipline is the medium through which all reform
becomes effective. The attitude of the warden toward reform
should be sympathetic and receptive.”</p>

<p>A paper on “Prison Labor,” by the Hon. John T. McDonough,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Ex-Secretary of State, was listened to with considerable
interest, because Mr. McDonough, as a member of
the Constitutional Convention of 1894, had much to do with
framing the constitutional amendment wiping out the contract
labor system and prohibiting the sale of prison-made
goods in the open market. Under the present laws of New
York no work can be done by convicts in competition with outside
labor. Whatever is made in the prisons of the State
must “be disposed of to the State or any political division
thereof, or for or to any public institution owned or managed
and controlled by the State, or any political division thereof.”
At the same time every inmate of the several State prisons,
penitentiaries, jails, and reformatories in the State, who is
physically able, must be set to work. By a strong array of
figures and apparently favorable comparisons Mr. McDonough
undertook to demonstrate the merits and success of the new
system. In replying to the paper, Dr. Barrows maintained that
in spite of the law several thousand prisoners in the jails and
penitentiaries of the State are supported in idleness.</p>

<p>Mr. John E. Van De Carr, Superintendent of the New
York City Reformatory of Misdemeanants, on Hart’s Island,
read a paper in which he gave an account of said institution
and its work. This reformatory, which is the only one in
the United States solely for misdemeanants, is the child of
Greater New York’s charter. By that charter it became the
duty of the Commissioner of Correction “to cause all criminals
and misdemeanants under his charge to be classified as far as
practicable, so that youthful and less hardened offenders shall
not be rendered more depraved by association with and the
example of the older and more hardened,” and “to set apart
one or more of the penal institutions in his department for
the custody of such youthful offenders.” By an act of the
Legislature, passed in 1904, the charter of the reform school
on Hart’s Island was amended, and the institution was continued
and known after January 1, 1905, as “The New York
City Reformatory of Misdemeanants.” To this “any male
person between the ages of sixteen and thirty, after conviction
by a magistrate or court in the city of New York of
any charge, offense, misdemeanor, or crime, other than a
felony, may be committed for reformatory treatment.” The
time of such imprisonment, which must not exceed three
years, but must continue at least three months, is terminated
by the Board of Parole, which consists of nine commissioners
who serve without compensation for a term of one year. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
first three rules under the system by means of which an
inmate may work out his release on parole (which is determined
by merit marks based on demeanor, labor, and study)
are as follows: 1. All inmates enter the New York City
Reformatory of Misdemeanants in the second grade. 2. If
such inmate shall obtain 900 merit marks he shall thereafter
enter the first or highest grade. 3. If such inmate shall violate
any rules of the Reformatory, or shall in any way be disobedient
or ungovernable, he shall be reduced to the third or
lowest grade; and no such inmate shall reënter the second
grade unless he shall have obtained 300 merit marks. When
an inmate is eligible for release on parole, and is so recommended
by the superintendent, he is placed on parole in charge
of a parole officer for a period of six months, provided he has
a home to go to, or employment whereby he can become self-sustaining.
Should he violate his parole at any time, the
Board of Parole has power to revoke the same and cause his
rearrest and reimprisonment as if said parole had not been
ordered. To make the system effective, the spiritual welfare
of the inmates is faithfully cared for by the Catholic, Protestant,
and Hebrew chaplains of the Department of Correction;
mental training is provided for by a teacher from the Board
of Education; and six different trade-schools furnish industrial
instruction. The results so far have proved very satisfactory,
the conduct of over eighty-three per cent. of those
paroled being reported as satisfactory. “Our experience has
already convinced us,” declares the superintendent, “that the
modern ideas on this subject are purely scientific, and not
sentimental, and that many sent to prison should first be
placed in some reformatory where the class of institution in
which they should justly be detained could safely be determined.
We also feel that it may become necessary to extend
the minimum term of three months to a longer period. A
sentence is really not reformatory if the minimum is three
months; at least the reformation is but temporary. Permanent
reformation requires the teaching of a trade, and a trade
cannot be learned in that time, although we have accomplished
surprising results in that period. To secure the greatest good
to the boy, the trades taught should be those that are best paid,
namely, the building trades.”</p>

<h4>AFTERNOON</h4>

<p>The principal address of the afternoon was by Mr. Warren
F. Spalding, Secretary of the Massachusetts Prison Association,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
on “Principles and Purposes of Probation.” He said in
part:</p>

<p>“The probation system is the natural outgrowth of modern
theories regarding the treatment of lawbreakers. The acceptance
of the proposition that the State should reform and reclaim
the offender led to the establishment of reformatories.
Later it was realized that some might reform without imprisonment,
even in a reformatory, and the probation officer became
their supervisor and custodian. His functions are to investigate
cases and report regarding past offenses, if any; general
character, home, dependents, etc., and the probability of reformation
without imprisonment, and he must visit probationers
and help them in the work of self-reformation.</p>

<p>“Probation is better than imprisonment for suitable cases,
because it saves the offender from the prison stigma, while it
keeps him under restraint, controlling his companionships, compelling
him to work and support those dependent upon him.</p>

<p>“The probation officer has custodial as well as supervisory
powers, and may surrender the probationer for misbehavior.
Probation turns the attention of its subject to the future rather
than the past. Punishment deals with one past act. Probation
deals with the future&mdash;with the establishment of character. It
puts the emphasis upon what the probationer must do, not upon
what he has done.</p>

<p>“Probation as a means of securing reformation has an
excellent record. Punishment has failed in a great proportion
of its cases. It is only reasonable that the records of the two
systems shall be compared. If the law of the survival of the
fittest is to prevail in this domain, it is certain that the use of
probation is destined for increase, and the use of imprisonment
to decrease, as a method of dealing with those who have broken
the laws. It will be adopted more and more generally because
it succeeds, while imprisonment will be more generally abandoned
because it fails.”</p>

<p>Papers were also read by Mr. H. F. Coates, Alliance, Ohio,
on “Probation for First Offenders,” and by Samuel J. Barrows,
New York, on “The Organization of Probation Work.” Mr.
J. G. Phelps-Stokes, New York, spoke on “The Justice of Probation.”
Charlton T. Lewis once said: “We are not dealing
with acts, but with actors; not with crimes, but with the men
who have committed them.” A man is largely the creature of
environment. Too often we overlook the fact that crime is
not always chargeable to the individual, but to his surroundings.
If punishment is to be just, we must know that he who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
is punished is justly punished. Some of the prolific causes of
a criminal career are evil associates, street training, and bad
homes. Do we ask as we should, whether those now in prison
had such favorable surroundings as the reputable portion of
society? How many children grow up without proper home
training! Their parents must go out to hard work to the
neglect of the children. There is no play for the child except
under evil influences; and in New York alone there are 85,000
children deprived of the benefits of a public school education because
of deficient school accommodations. Among those who
can go to school, truancy is not uncommon. The recreation
which every child needs is found by many in saloons, dance
halls, cheap theatres, and other demoralizing places. The stress
of hard work and long hours also makes it impossible for many
parents to care properly for their children. Do we wonder that
under such circumstances only harmful influences come to
them? Punishment is just only in proportion to culpability;
and yet how many have no opportunity to learn what is right
or wrong!</p>

<p>The conditions to which first offenders are subjected in
many prisons are simply appalling. Hundreds are thrown in
with the vilest beings and the most hardened criminals, and are,
in addition, obliged in the majority of prisons to endure a living
death by reason of the most unsanitary surroundings. It is
horrible to sentence a man, woman or child, not only to moral
degradation, but to a physical death as well. Imprisonment as
a corrective and deterrent is a failure. Punishment can have
but two justifications: the correction of the offender, and the
protection of society. Probation, on the other hand, at least
results in making one refrain from such criminal acts as will
send him to prison.</p>

<h4>EVENING</h4>

<p>The speaker of the evening was Mrs. Maud Ballington
Booth, of the Volunteers of America, who delivered a most
eloquent and sympathetic address on “The Hopeful Side of
Prison Work.” Mrs. Booth began her work among “her boys”
behind the bars ten years ago, at the time of the division in the
Salvation Army, which resulted in the formation of the Volunteers
of America. To-day she is everywhere known among
prisoners and ex-convicts as “The Little Mother.” Mrs. Booth
said in part: “I am not here to instruct wardens and chaplains,
nor have I come to represent myself, but the work of the
organization for which I stand. I see before me another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
audience to-night, namely, those behind the bars. All I know
regarding this work is from within the walls, and I speak,
therefore, from the standpoint of the prisoner. I was always
told that the task with criminals was a hopeless one, but I have
learned to know better. People who talk like that have never
been behind the walls of a prison. The theorist looks upon
convicts as men who are generally unredeemable. Not so the
wardens and chaplains and other prison workers, who have had
practical experience. No man or woman would be any good
among prisoners without hope. Where there is life there is
hope. I do not forget the crime or the stain, and am not a
sentimentalist regarding the reformation of criminals; but I
firmly believe that no one has fallen so low as to be absolutely
beyond redemption. Many of those behind the bars have from
earliest childhood never known anything of human or divine
love; but have only been cuffed about in the world. Bring
these the touch of sympathy, and tell them something of the
Father’s love and of the Saviour’s power to save, and you
again bring hope into their lives. This must be the foundation
of our work <i>within</i> the prison; and where those who
have served their time come out, it is love again&mdash;mother love,
if you please&mdash;that must direct their course. In dealing with
the convict, our first endeavor must be to enkindle new hope
within his heart; and toward the ex-convict the public must
assume a better attitude. Finally, if we leave God out we
shall not succeed.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Tuesday, September 18</span></h3>

<h4>MORNING</h4>

<p>This day of the Congress had been set apart by the New
York State Prison Department for an excursion to beautiful
Lake George. At 8.30 o’clock over three hundred delegates
left Albany by special train. On arrival at Lake George the
steamer <i>Horicon</i> was boarded, and after a sail of several hours
on the lake, the excursionists were landed at “The Sagamore,”
where a basket luncheon was served, after which the meeting
of the Chaplains’ Association was held, the Rev. William J.
Batt, D. D., of the Massachusetts State Reformatory, in the
chair.</p>

<p>After a brief paper by the Rev. W. E. Edgin, Chaplain
of the Indiana State Reformatory, Jeffersonville, on “Soul-Winning
in a Reformatory,” and an address by Prof. Edward
Everett Hale, the president introduced Mr. Joseph F. Scott,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
of the Elmira Reformatory, whose admirable paper on “The
Chaplain from the Warden’s Point of View,” we here reproduce
in full:</p>

<p>“Because prisoners are men, they have the same impulses,
motives, hopes, and aspirations, and are susceptible to the
same influences and amenable to the same forces as other
men, though possibly in a less degree. Because some men are
prisoners they need the same inspiration, faith, strength, and
courage that other men find themselves in need of.</p>

<p>“In the prison of which I am superintendent, there are
burglars, pickpockets, and thieves of every description. There
is no law on the statute books that has not its offenders there,
and they are thought of and spoken of by people in general as
such. But when the parents of one of these write me, they
say, ‘My son’; or if the brother or sister write, they say, ‘My
brother’; and I believe if it were possible for me to hear the
words of the Father in Heaven, concerning one of these, they
would be, ‘My son,’ or the words of Jesus, ‘My brother.’
Should not our words be the same?</p>

<p>“If I had a son of my own I should insist upon such rules
of diet, sleep, and exercise as would insure to him a healthful
body and a good constitution, such education, necessary to a
well-disciplined mind, such works or pursuits to assure success
in life; such disciplinary and moral training as would build
up a stable character; all to the end that his place in life would
be that of a useful citizen. The need of the prisoner and the
prison discipline brought to bear upon him need be nothing
more, and should be nothing less than this. He needs physical
development, mental quickening, industrial training, discipline
and moral instruction, if he is to be returned to society a
self-sustaining and useful citizen; and no prison is doing its
proper work that does not in some way afford means for these
essential elements of discipline.</p>

<p>“The moral instruction is the especial work of the prison
chaplain, and he should be given that freedom of action and
breadth of scope to make his work efficient. I believe that
Christianity is the greatest moral force in the lives of men
to-day, because it has humanity as the basis of its ethics. It
has come down through the years as a forming, transforming
and reforming force in the lives of men, and I believe it is
to go on through the ages until selfishness shall have been
uprooted, and men brought closer and closer together; when
we shall love our neighbor and be willing to work for him
as for ourselves, and will do unto others as we would be done
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
by; when we shall live in one great fraternal organization;
when wars, and robberies, and strife shall cease and poverty
shall be no more; when the strong shall carry the burden of
the weak, and succor the unfortunate, and men will live together
in brotherly love, under a Christian socialism or in the
New Jerusalem, or such designation as you may please to give
it. This force, which has accomplished and is to accomplish
so much for the world, we cannot deny a place in transforming
the lives and characters of prisoners, to that of upright living.</p>

<p>“The prison chaplain, in his work among prisoners,
should thoroughly believe that these great Christian forces
which have done so much for the world are applicable to the
men under his charge and are as efficient in their lives as in
the lives of other men; and any Christian clergyman, desirous
of helping his fellow men and entering into the service of the
Lord and humanity, and of placing himself where he can do
the most good, should not hesitate to accept a prison chaplaincy;
and a call to such a place should be in his mind equal
to the call to one of the best churches in the land.</p>

<p>“It is not my purpose to give a detailed outline for the
work of a prison chaplain. No two men can perhaps be successful
and do their work in the same way; but every person
connected with the prison, be he superintendent, warden, or
chaplain, or other officer, should seek every inspiration and
good example and ideal within his possibilities, and then simply
be his natural self in dealing with the prisoners’ needs.</p>

<p>“When I was superintendent of the Massachusetts Reformatory
at Concord, it was the custom there to avail ourselves
of the services of the students from Andover Theological
Seminary. One student, fresh from his work in the
seminary, came into my office one day and asked me what he
should do in the prison. I told him that if I were to get some
one to do what I wanted done, I would probably get some one
else, but that I expected him to go into prison, mingle freely
with the prisoners, and find something, some place where he
thought he could be of use to them, and give those qualities in
himself that he thought would be of the most help. And that
is what I would say to a prison chaplain entering the work.
Where one is strong another may be weak, and each should
work along those lines where he himself feels that he can do
the greatest good. The compensation of a prison chaplain
should be sufficient to command the services of clergymen of
high attainments, and to support themselves and families in a
comfortable way. And never should a chaplaincy be looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
upon as a place for a broken-down clergyman, or one who has
failed in other fields of activity. The chaplain should be given,
as I have previously said, sufficient latitude and freedom of
action in the prison to carry on the work in such lines as he
himself feels that he can be of the greatest service. Therefore,
the superintendent, or warden, should not place upon the
chaplain such routine duties as will interfere with his doing
this. It is recognized by all that the Sabbath is the special
day for the chaplain’s work. I believe that we should go
further than this, and set aside to him some portion of each
day for such religious work as he deems best. He should not
be burdened with such work as supervising inmates’ correspondence,
the library, teaching school, or the many routine
duties which are foisted upon him in many instances, unless
he feels that they may be avenues through which he may do
his best work.</p>

<p>“If there was one injunction of the Saviour which has
given more impetus to Christianity in the world than another,
it was His last, ‘Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations,’ or,
as found in the other gospel, ‘Go ye into all the world and
preach the gospel to every creature.’ I believe this injunction
is especially applicable to prisoners, and that the chaplain,
first of all, should be a teacher, and his intercourse with
the prisoners should be in the form of teaching. Most prisoners
are without the truth, and they need to be instructed in
the truth, and my experience is that most of them are desirous
of learning the truth. And I believe that no chaplain
ever failed to interest or impress prisoners when he preached
to them a sermon teaching them the simple gospel. I have
never failed to see, in a prison chapel, the attention of the men
arrested by the simple reading of the gospel, or anything pertaining
to the life or teachings of Jesus Christ, or the explanation,
by the chaplain, of what those simple truths and teachings
consist in. I believe that any chaplain makes a mistake
when he goes before his congregation of prisoners with other
subjects than the simple gospel, if he thinks thereby to awaken
greater interest in other ways.</p>

<p>“Phillips Brooks, when he used to visit the institution
at Concord, it was said, never varied his sermons one jot or
tittle in presenting them to the prisoners of that reformatory,
than in giving them to his cultured congregation in Trinity
Church, and he never failed to instruct, impress, and move
his congregation of prisoners as no other man to whom I ever
listened. And that leads me to the point that I believe that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
all religious services in a prison should be carried through with
the same care on the part of the clergyman, and with the same
dignity with which he would conduct the services in any
church. The ritual of the church service always appeals to
prisoners. The services of the mass, or the ritual of the synagogue,
never fail in receiving the reverent attention of the
devotees of those faiths; and my observation is that prisoners
always respond to those services in which they themselves are
largely participants. Congregational singing, responsive readings,
repetition of Psalms and the Lord’s Prayer are usually
entered into with interest and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“The prison chaplain should be keen in his appreciation
of human nature, in dealing with the individual prisoner, that
he may see the good that exists in each prisoner with whom
he comes in contact, and work upon that side of his character.
Humanity is much alike the world over. Race and condition
have not so much influence upon the characteristics as we
sometimes believe. In the modern American prison will be
found prisoners from nearly every nationality under the sun.
Their methods of evil are about the same, and they all respond
to the same influences, and are actuated by the same motives,
each as the other; and the prison chaplain who has learned
this, and has learned that there is always something in every
prisoner which he can draw out and develop, is well on the
road to successful dealing with them. It is not so much the
work of the superintendent, warden, or chaplain, to make
over a man into something else, as it is to develop him along
the lines of his better self.</p>

<p>“When the Saviour called the fishermen, Peter and
Andrew, to be his disciples, he did not say to them, ‘Follow
me, and I will make you into great orators, or great preachers,’
but, ‘I will make you fishers of men.’ So, when we approach
the prisoner, we should not ask him to be something
different from himself, but should try to bring out and develop
his better self; by holding before his vision the ideal Man,
which is Jesus, and the ideal society, which is Christianity
in its perfection.”</p>

<h4>EVENING</h4>

<p>The evening session was again held in the Senate Chamber
of the Capitol. The first address was made by Mr. Frederick
G. Pettigrove, Chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Prison
Commissioners, on “What a Central System May Do to Promote
the Efficiency of Prison Methods.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>“A world-famous essayist and statesman said that a complete
theory of government would be a noble present to mankind,
but he added, it is a present that one could neither hope
nor pretend to offer. We are forced to remember this limitation
when we examine the various systems of prison government
and attempt to suggest remedies for the deficiencies in them. I
shall try to show that in whatever way the prisons are governed
there are certain reformatory methods and agencies that can
be made much more effective and available by the aid of a central
system than by being left entirely to local administration.
I shall make no attack upon any system, because it would be unjust
and ungracious not to remember the great service that has
been rendered to the State by the able and philanthropic men
and women who have devoted their services to the prisons, and
have striven to lift them from mere places of detention to a condition
of high public service.</p>

<p>“If all the corrective methods that are now stamped with
the approval of public sentiment could be maintained to the best
advantage in a single prison, there would be no need of any
central authority. It could not be contended that a general
board would be any wiser in appointments than the local boards
of management. Nor could there be any larger or more humane
interest in the affairs of a particular prison, than is shown by
the supervisors who have only one prison under their charge.
But it would be manifestly impossible, in the larger States at
least, to include in a single establishment all the various agencies
that are needed for the discipline, the training and the treatment
of prisoners; and it is therefore essential that different places
should be provided to furnish opportunities best suited to the
capacities and the needs of the widely differing individuals.</p>

<p>“The managers of one prison cannot command a knowledge
of all the prisons as well as a central board, and if the
methods that are now employed are to be used for the greatest
good, and to be made available for the largest number of offenders,
there must be some general authority to rearrange and reassign
prisoners after they have been committed.</p>

<p>“I have no intention here of proposing that the State should
take absolute control of all the penal institutions, or even that
the authority of all boards of management should be measurably
disturbed; but only that some central board should so far possess
authority over all the penal establishments as to be enabled to
make a rearrangement that would promote efficiency of effort.</p>

<p>“In order to show how such a degree of centrality might
be sufficient for large reforms let me outline briefly what I believe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
would be the best method of classification of prisoners if
all suitable facilities could be given by the legislature:</p>

<p>“I would recommend the establishment of one receiving
prison for all persons convicted of serious crimes and sentenced
to hard labor; in this place prisoners would be held under continual
observation for a period long enough to allow the authorities
to decide where the prisoner would apparently be likely to
receive the most benefit, or where he could be kept with the
most advantage to the State.</p>

<p>“As accessories to this place I would provide departmental
prisons, in each of which some particular element of instruction
or discipline or treatment should be brought to the highest
possible degree of efficiency, such as schools for the illiterate,
the manual-training school and schools for trade instruction.</p>

<p>“Another department should be assigned to those who are
mentally weak, so that they could be put constantly under special
guardianship. There are in the prisons, as we all know, many
persons who, while not so far below the normal intelligence as
to warrant the experts in declaring them to be insane, are nevertheless
incapable of performing any useful work or of taking
any benefit from prison agencies. In most States provision has
been made for the removal of prisoners who are actually insane
to an asylum specially provided for that class; but so far there
has been no similar establishment created for the safe detention
of prisoners who are found to be so far deficient in intelligence
as to need the sort of treatment that is given in the schools for
the feeble-minded.</p>

<p>“Another humane department would be a hospital prison,
an establishment that should combine the needed safeguards for
custody with all the essential features for the most scientific and
skillful treatment of the different ailments. To be sure it would
be necessary to maintain a small infirmary in each prison for
emergency cases, but all cases requiring long and continuous
treatment would be removed to the hospital prison.</p>

<p>“The last stage of all in such a plan as I outline should be
a prison where the guardianship over the prisoner would be relaxed
by degrees, so that he could approach his freedom in such
a way as to regain some degree of self-reliance.</p>

<p>“To make the general plan of a classified prison system
harmonious and effective, the particular place of imprisonment
should not be unalterably fixed at the outset. In effect to-day
the court in Massachusetts does not absolutely determine the
place of imprisonment. The central board has the power to
make transfers from one prison to another, with the single exception
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
that no person can be put into the state prison from
another place.</p>

<p>“I have seen in other places, however, many prisoners who
manifestly belonged in the state prison.</p>

<p>“It would be needless to recite cases of inequitable sentences
that show the need of classification. As a type of many others
I mention one instance where, through lack of knowledge of the
prisoner’s antecedents, a justice sentenced to the reformatory a
man who had been six times under imprisonment, including a
term in the state prison, and as far as one human being can
judge of another, had shown himself incapable of amendment
or unwilling to accept the means of reformation.</p>

<p>“Information that may be immediately available to the
prison authorities when the prisoner is committed, so that they
can assign him to his fit place, is in most cases lacking when
the prisoner is before the court. The needed adjustment of
prisoners I think could be made by a central authority having
all places within its purview, after conference with the prison
officials.</p>

<p>“In what other ways can we make centrality help a prison
system? We can do it by requiring, as many States have done,
that all reports of prisons shall go to a central office so that there
shall be available to the central board the needed information
in regard to the prisons. We can do it by the establishment
of a more effective method of registration, so that there shall be
available for the guidance of the transfer board all the records
of prisoners, whether obtained in one State or another.</p>

<p>“Under the same authority with the bureau of registration
and identification, all the data possessed by that department
would be accessible to the agent who was seeking to discover
how far it might be practicable and useful to assist a prisoner
at liberty. A central registration office would in the end yield
a large return to the State by securing a comprehensive oversight
of prisoners on parole. In the central office in Massachusetts
we endeavor to keep a record of all prisoners at liberty
from the prisons under our supervision. This, to be sure, is not
always easy to do, because names are readily changed and it is
not difficult to conceal identity. The only reliable method of
following up the prisoners at liberty is to maintain a system of
identification based upon the plan that does not rely on names,
or upon any data that is subject to change.</p>

<p>“What the scheme of registration has done for this State
and for other States cannot now be measured, but the interest
that has been excited in this subject and the information that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
has been spread from the central office must prove invaluable
to the police and prison officials of the entire country. When
all the States adopt this plan it will not only be difficult
for a paroled prisoner to evade his obligations to keep the
terms of his release in his own State, but he will find if he
returns to evil practices in another State that his record will
be readily brought against him.</p>

<p>“All that I have said so far has seemed to apply mainly to
persons convicted of felonies, but I intended that there also
should be comprehended in the scheme a large number of misdemeanants,
who need generally the same sort of correction and
training as felons.</p>

<p>“There is one class of misdemeanants, however, which I
would exclude as a rule from any elaborate prison system, although
the place for their detention might be made one of the
departments of the plan I have described, and that is the large
number of persons committed for drunkenness. Most of these
have passed beyond the age when they would be the best subjects
for an industrial reformatory. They have no criminal
instincts, are merely social disturbers, and what the State does
in the way of their correction should be different from the
means employed in the care of criminals. And the persons
committed for drunkenness can be dealt with in a better way
than now prevails if they are drawn into larger groups where
fitting employment can be given; and this arrangement would
need the intervention of a central board.</p>

<p>“Under a well-organized and thoroughly equipped system,
with such a degree of centrality as I have indicated, all the beneficent
methods of the prisons would be sustained and
strengthened.”</p>

<p>The second address of the evening was by Dr. Frederick
Howard Wines, on “The Prisons of Louisiana.” Residence
in the South and an intimate acquaintance with Southern
people and Southern prisons, gave the utterances of Dr. Wines
authoritative value. The prison question in the South, he
said, is almost exclusively a negro question. The greater proportion
of crime in the South is committed by negroes. Hence
most of the prisoners are negroes. The negro prisoner is a
distinct problem. The methods we apply to white prisoners
are not applicable to him. The religion of the negro, for example,
is altogether emotional and has little connection with
morality. As to education, the Southern people do not greatly
favor the education of the negro. A partly educated negro
thinks he belongs to a select class and must no longer work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
As to the question of labor, he is not fitted for indoor work,
nor wanted by the industrial classes.</p>

<p>As conditions are in Louisiana, I can think of nothing
better than the large plantations on which the convicts are
employed. The barracks are absolutely clean and sanitary.
There are no chains. The guards are unarmed. After breakfast
the prisoners go to the cotton and sugar fields, accompanied
by armed guards and hounds. There are few escapes
and very little punishment. Hospital and physician are provided.
All the convicts are well fed, and at the close of the
day’s work all must take a bath. As the labor is steady it is
more profitable than that of the free man. All the earnings
go to the support and improvement of the prisons and prisoners.
The lease system is gone in all the counties but one.
Baton Rouge has the only prison of the old style, with walls,
etc. Camps are now the thing, on plantations. Since the
abolition of the lease system, and the adoption of State control,
the health of the prisoners is much better.</p>

<p>A third address by Mr. F. B. Sanborn, Concord, Mass.,
on “Prison Reform and Prison Science,” was largely a review
of the results accomplished in the past forty years, and
reminiscent of the many eminent men associated with the
movement since its inception.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Wednesday, September 19</span></h3>

<h4>MORNING</h4>

<p>The session of the Physicians’ Association, held this
morning, was most interesting, and was marked by some
notable features. The President, Dr. S. H. Blitch, Ocala,
Florida, presented a paper on “The Open versus the Close
Penitentiary System of Handling Prisoners,” in which he
took strong ground in favor of the former, especially in the
South. He defined the “open” penitentiary system as that
mode of social restraint according to which the prisoner sentenced
to hard labor is required to perform skilled and unskilled
service in fields, woods, and surface mining, and in
such industries and occupations as do not necessitate his daily
cellular or circumscribed confinement, as is the case under the
“close” system. He claimed that in spite of criticism, the
“open” system, wherever climatic conditions make it practicable,
is far more conducive to the mental and physical rehabilitation
of the convict than the “close” system. In the
South, especially where the vast majority of prisoners are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
negroes who have been accustomed to life in the open air and
to outdoor employment, the confinement in a “close” penitentiary
would be most detrimental. The open-air system puts
these men at work under conditions to which they have been
accustomed from youth up, and the results demonstrate the
wisdom of the plan.</p>

<p>In the discussion which followed this paper, Dr. Barrows
said that many penologists felt that the Southern system had
many advantages, but that other industrial and reformatory
elements should be added. Dr. Wines saw an immense advantage
in the Southern method, and claimed that Northern
prisons would find it very beneficial to have farms connected
with them for the outdoor employment of convicts.</p>

<p>The paper on “Prison Sanitation,” by Dr. W. D. Stewart,
West Virginia Penitentiary, Moundsville, was followed by that
of Dr. S. A. Knopf, of New York, on “The Tuberculosis
Problem in Prisons and Reformatories.” The presentation
made by this eminent specialist on tuberculosis was probably
the most exhaustive on this subject to which the Congress
ever listened. This very valuable paper, any condensation of
which would do it injustice, is published in full in the <i>New
York Medical Journal</i>, November 17, 1906, to which the
reader is referred.</p>

<p>Dr. J. W. Milligan, Indiana State Prison, Michigan City,
read a paper on “Mental Defectives Among Prisoners,” of
which the following is a synopsis: Where reformation, not
punishment, is the aim, a just estimate of the prisoner’s mental
state is essential. Without this the indeterminate sentence
cannot be successful. Communities as well as courts too frequently
overlook mental defect as an important element in
crime. Too many prisoners on admission are insane, epileptic,
or feeble-minded. Epilepsy is not an infrequent factor, especially
in atrocious crimes without motive, and overlooked because
<i>not of the pronounced type</i> popularly considered characteristic
of this disease.</p>

<p>Indiana prison records show among the defectives, a percentage
for murder <i>three times</i>; for murder, manslaughter,
and rape, <i>twice</i>; but for larceny, <i>two-thirds</i> that of the average
for all classes. On admission, forty-four per cent. admit
mental defect or criminal record, in the personal or family
history. This tainted influx, and the fact that defectives are
not paroled, explains why twelve per cent. of our population
is insane, epileptic, or feeble-minded.</p>

<p>The psychosis are chiefly degenerative in type. Insane
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
among prisoners are not especially difficult to manage; no
harsh measures are ever justifiable. Indiana has as yet no
institution for insane criminals; it needs one badly. A ward
in the prison hospital gives good results, though far from
ideal. Insane criminals should be judged in the light of
modern psychiatry, and their rights and the safety of society
carefully guarded.</p>

<h4>AFTERNOON</h4>

<p>Mr. C. W. Bowron, Superintendent of the Wisconsin
State Reformatory, Green Bay, presented the Report of the
Committee on Prevention and Reformatory Work, in a paper
entitled, “Reformatory Sentences and Discharges,” which concluded
with the following propositions:</p>

<p>1. That the authority to transfer prisoners from the reformatory
to state prison is an essential safeguard to the successful
management of a reformatory; and this power on the
part of prison officials has been abundantly upheld by the
courts.</p>

<p>2. That the so-called indeterminate sentence has been repeatedly
held valid, but apparently upon the construction that
it is a definite sentence for the maximum limit. It is therefore
a misnomer.</p>

<p>3. That the fixing of a minimum period in the indeterminate
sentence is illogical, and detrimental to reformatory purposes.</p>

<p>4. That the power of parole is purely an administrative
function exercised in the establishment of a prison regulation,
the validity of which has been upheld by the courts; and that
the determination of parole should largely if not wholly rest
with the principal officers of the institution.</p>

<p>5. That the parole system does not depend upon the so-called
indeterminate sentence, or any other form of sentence,
but stands apart from it as a separate and distinct reformatory
element.</p>

<p>6. That a definite and uniform sentence fixed by statute,
subject to modification through the legal powers of the administrative
officers to parole and discharge, is not inconsistent
with reformatory purposes, and in some respects is an advantage
to reformatory management.</p>

<p>7. That final discharge after a suitable term of probation
on parole is a just and essential feature of the merit system,
in which the pardoning power should coöperate with the
reformatory officials.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>8. That the indefinite sentence does not exist, probably
cannot constitutionally exist, possibly ought not to exist, and
certainly would be the object of severe criticism if it did
exist.</p>

<p>9. That a central bureau of identification operated by the
general government is so essential to the proper ends of justice
that its establishment would mark an important advancement
in our criminal jurisprudence.</p>

<p>“Methods of Reformatory Administration” was the subject
of a paper by Mr. W. H. Whittaker, Superintendent of
the Indiana State Reformatory, Jeffersonville. Mr. Whittaker
claimed that in many institutions methods had not kept
pace with advancing civilization. Ideal reformatory management
must, first of all, have a solid foundation to stand upon.
Said foundation consists of the men in charge of an institution.
These, from the superintendent down, should be men
of broad intelligence, good morals, and clean habits, who thoroughly
believe that they are their brothers’ keepers, and who,
in the discharge of all their duties, will constantly have in
view the reformation of the prisoner. No good results can
come from physical punishment or the employment of such
methods as humiliate the prisoner. All methods should aim
to secure the harmonious training of the heart, the head, and
the hand, and should have for their one purpose the building
of character.</p>

<p>In a paper on “The Delinquent Girl,” Mrs. Lucy M.
Sickels, Superintendent of the State Industrial Home, Adrian,
Michigan, pointed out that the real delinquent in most cases
is the parent. The delinquent girl is not born so. She comes
into the world with all the winning graces of babyhood; but
when she reaches the years of girlhood, she is allowed to have
her own way and to run wild. The mother is perhaps so busy
attending missionary and temperance meetings, endeavoring
to save others, that she has no time for her own daughter.
If the girl has no mother, or a widowed mother, who, in
order to support her little family, is obliged to go out to hard
work day after day, until she becomes nervous, impatient, and
petulant, an equally unfortunate situation again presents itself.
Or parents are constantly quarreling, until divorce stalks in,
breaks up the home, and sets the children adrift. In eight cases
out of ten, ill temper and divorce in the home are the cause of
delinquency. Delinquency or incorrigibility is only another
name for parental neglect. What we want are laws to protect
the children and punish the delinquent parent, for this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
is the root of all the evil we are striving and contending
against.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sickels outlined the methods followed in the institution
which she directs. “We go back to the first home principles,
a mother and a mother’s love. A manager or mother
is at the head of each family home, of which we have eight,
each family having a kitchen, dining room, and laundry, just
as complete in itself as you are from your neighbor. Each
family cooks its own food, makes its own bread, and does its
own laundry work. Each girl has a nice little room all to
herself, in which is a single bed covered with a clean white
spread, a pretty pillow sham on the pillow, a dresser, a mirror,
a rug and a chair. Each room has a large airy window. The
girl may beautify the walls and dresser according to her own
taste and skill.</p>

<p>“The first requisite for a girl as she enters the Home is
<i>occupation</i>, not work only. It may mean work, but instruction
is given along all lines most necessary and useful to every
woman in order to fit her to be a housekeeper and home-maker.”
A chapel, in which two services are held each Lord’s
Day, a schoolhouse and graded school with eight teachers, a
hospital and trained nurse, a sewing school, a cooking school,
a dressmaking department, a greenhouse, and an orchestra
and brass band composed of girls, form part of the equipment.
There is no wall or fence around the Home, but a clear open
space and beautiful lawn, with walks and flowers, shrubbery
and trees. The results obtained have been most satisfactory,
at least seventy-five per cent. of the girls so far received having
turned out good, true women, many of them being devoted
wives and mothers.</p>

<h4>EVENING</h4>

<p>Mr. Alexander Johnson, General Secretary National
Conference of Charities and Correction, Indianapolis, Indiana,
spoke on “The Reformation of Jails.” Many county jails, he
declared, are a blot on civilization. Should this be the case
when we seek the reformation of the prisoner? Reform has
begun at the top of the prison system, but the jails have made
little progress upward, and a great number deserve to be
called “schools of vice.” What is the remedy? The physical
condition of the county jail must be improved. Each prisoner
should be separately confined. The fundamental error is that
the jails are used for two dissimilar purposes: for men awaiting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
trial, and for men who are sentenced. The two do not
belong together. I have seen these two classes together in the
same cell, and treated perfectly alike. When a man has been
convicted he no longer belongs to the county, but to the State,
and should be sent to a State institution. Then the jail would
remain only as a place of detention for those awaiting trial.
But why the State? Because the county would hardly be
justified in going to the expense of supporting a real work-house.
Another reform imperatively needed is speedier trials.
It is infamous to hold a man in jail for months awaiting trial.
“I hope the time will come when the question will be, ‘What
kind of a man is this, that we may fit him for society.’ When
we make our prisons hospitals for the moral reformation of
men, we will realize that the jail will be the place in which
to begin.”</p>

<p>“The Juvenile Court: Its Uses and Limitations,” was
the title of a paper by Dr. Hastings H. Hart, Superintendent
of the Illinois Children’s Home and Aid Society, Chicago.
The juvenile court is an evolution. Some twenty States have
juvenile court laws&mdash;all within about six years. This evolution
is still in progress, and the matter still in its infancy.</p>

<p>The juvenile court is founded on three great ideas: 1.
The value of the child for its own sake and for the community.
2. The abandonment of the <i>lex talionis</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, the infliction of
a punishment commensurate with the wrong done. This is
impossible as well as a wrong. No man is wise enough to
adjust the punishment accurately to the crime. 3. The recognition
of the responsibility of the mother State for the children,
especially for the erring and neglected ones.</p>

<p>The first essential feature of the juvenile court is the
breadth of its scope: it deals with delinquents and dependents.
The second is the character of its proceedings. “What is the
best possible thing to be done for the good of the child?” This
is the question which the juvenile court endeavors to solve
every day. A third feature of the juvenile court is that it
places the child in such hands as will do what is best for it.
Having such a high character and such noble purposes, no
jurist is too eminent to serve as a juvenile court judge. Another
distinctive mark of the juvenile court law is the probation
officer, who is the very heart of the work, and who not
only learns to know the child in the home, but also represents
it in the court. Finally the juvenile court recognizes the great
fundamental principle that the home and family, when properly
constituted are the great molders of character.

<h3><span class="smcap">Thursday, September 20</span></h3>

<h4>MORNING</h4>

<p>From the proceedings of Thursday morning the following
admirable paper by Mr. C. E. Haddox, Warden of the
West Virginia Penitentiary, Moundsville, is selected and reproduced
in full:</p>

<h3>SOME ELEMENTS OF PRISON DISCIPLINE</h3>

<p>Old Noah Webster, in that charming book of his entitled
“Dictionary,” of which Bill Nye says his chief criticism is
that it changes the subject too often, gives the following definition
of discipline:</p>

<p>“Education, instruction, cultivation, and improvement;
comprehending instruction in arts, sciences, correct sentiments,
morals, and manners, and due subordination to authority.”</p>

<p>These are not all the elements Webster says constitute
discipline, but they are quite enough upon which to base a
paper, and it is well enough to keep this definition in mind,
especially for such as may have the impression that discipline
consists solely and alone in administering punishments for real
or imaginary, deliberate or unintentional, breaches of good
conduct.</p>

<p>To the unthinking, the sole object of imprisoning a convict
may be regarded as the making him suffer for the crime
he committed, and that the judge in imposing sentence should
calculate how much suffering will be commensurate with the
crime, and adjust the sentence accordingly, the prison authorities
then taking hold of him, holding him in “durance vile”
for the period of his sentence, keeping him as quiet and orderly
as they can, and when his sentence has expired, discharging
him without further concern or responsibility for him or his
future.</p>

<h4>THE SCOPE OF DISCIPLINE</h4>

<p>Discipline comprehends in its fullest scope absolutely
everything that has to do with the convict, as to his training
physically, morally, intellectually, and spiritually, and embraces
in its application every agency that has to do with his
development as a laborer, his advancement as a student and a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
thinker, his uplifting morally and spiritually, and his complete
and perfect rounding out as a man.</p>

<p>It does not refer alone to the agency of the dark cell, the
strap, the taking of good time, the bath, the ball and chain,
and similar devices; and in a properly conducted, well-ordered,
and painstaking institution, these agencies are far
and away the smallest, least used and least effective of
all those which make and promote this thing called “discipline.”</p>

<p>In a rightfully planned and properly manned prison, the
officers maintain much the same attitude toward the heterogeneous
population there gathered&mdash;most of whom are children
in mental attainments, children in moral culture, children
in industrial bent&mdash;that a parent occupies toward his
child. The motive, the hope, the desire, the object, the plans,
and the efforts should be much the same, changed and modified
only as the conditions necessarily demand a modification of
plans.</p>

<p>The thoughtful and intelligent parent ponders and studies
about the future of his child. He knows that he must fit and
prepare him for the solemn duties of life, and upon the preparation
or lack of preparation he gives him, the discipline or
the lack of discipline the child undergoes, will depend that
child’s future welfare or misery.</p>

<p>If the parent is wise he carefully arranges for the child’s
physical well-being, he plans for his mental cultivation and
discipline, and provides systematically for proper environments
and training for his moral and spiritual growth and
strength. Nothing is left to chance, little to precept, much
to example, and the use of the rod or other correctional methods
or devices, is an obvious confession of a failure on the
part of the parent to take all the necessary care and precaution
in training or drilling the child. No child ever needed physical
correction at the hand of its parent, that the parent was not
also some to blame in neglecting precautions that would have
obviated this necessity.</p>

<p>Rev. Samuel J. Barrows, to whom prison people are under
so many lasting obligations for his invaluable contributions to
prison literature, said no truer thing than when in his admirable
address at Kansas City, in 1901, on “Jesus as a Penologist,”
he said:</p>

<p>“The ideal discipline is that which educates and strengthens
the will without breaking it, and which develops a man
without crushing him.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>

<h4>LABOR AS DISCIPLINE</h4>

<p>The first and prime requisite to discipline is a proper
labor system that calls for a reasonable amount of satisfactory,
productive, remunerative labor from every convict fit
to labor. It is altogether the greatest problem that confronts
any prison, and is most vital.</p>

<p>Idleness in prison is grossly wasteful, utterly uneconomical,
terribly demoralizing, and prevents almost entirely all
plans for a regimen that looks to discipline. For those in
health there should be no wasted hours at any time or any
place in prison.</p>

<p>A score of idle or partly idle convicts can do more mischief,
subvert more discipline, destroy more regularity and
system than a regiment of men kept at proper, legitimate employment.
So the key to discipline is a labor system that embraces
in its scope every person in prison.</p>

<p>To devise a system of labor for an institution that will
keep everyone sufficiently employed and underwork none (for
strange to say, in practice, the prison that overtaxes convicts
probably does not exist), is the hardest problem, requiring the
most labor, care, and attention that could possibly be imagined,
and means that the warden who accomplishes it and continues
it will be the most severely taxed of all. It is not the convict
that is likely to do an honest, just day’s work, but the
management who undertake to see that this most vital and
salutary agent of discipline is always in full force and effect.</p>

<h4>THE CONTRACT SYSTEM</h4>

<p>I have no sympathy with those who inveigh against contract
labor in prisons. A contract system in which the State
receives the proper compensation for the labor of convicts, and
the convict receives a just compensation for surplus work, a
system which eliminates the abuses formerly found in contracts,
a system in which the government, control, and treatment
of the men is in the hands of the prison officials only,
and the amount and the kind of labor is adjusted by the warden
only, may be the best practicable economic system.</p>

<p>The abuses formerly chargeable to the contract system,
and possibly chargeable now in sections, are not necessary, and
existed and exist only because prison officials permitted them
or fostered them; and instead of abolishing the system, men
should have been substituted who would prepare a proper contract,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
obtain the right compensation, secure rational treatment
for the convicts, and get just conditions generally, and have
the invaluable experience of expert manufacturers to teach
the men deft and skillful labor at something they know becomes
a factor in the world beyond the walls.</p>

<p>Shall the meat packing and producing business be destroyed
because great abuses have recently been unearthed, or
shall it be reformed and corrected?</p>

<p>Shall the oil industry be wiped out because an undue share
of the benefits are absorbed by a few, or shall the conditions
be changed, the wrongs be righted?</p>

<p>Just think of the consistency of the people who rail at
the contract system in prisons, but view with complacency the
spectacle, in the East Side of New York, of almost countless
thousands of children of four years of age, and sometimes
younger, working in basements fourteen hours a day, making
paper bags at four cents per thousand; or three-and-a-half-year-old
children making artificial flowers on Mott Street, at
eight cents per gross! Twenty-three thousand licensed, not to
speak of the unknown thousands of unlicensed, tenement
houses (home) factories in the city of New York, of the State
of New York, which sternly forbids any form of contract
labor in prison!</p>

<p>Far be it from me to criticise the State account system,
ideal, utopian; but the superintendent who can combine the
business qualities necessary to run successfully and economically
the factories with the executive qualifications requisite for
the other duties of prison governments, is certainly a prodigy,
and cannot often be found.</p>

<h4>THE REFORMATORY</h4>

<p>Neither have I anything to say against the reformatory
system of manual training, so called, which builds only to destroy
again, except to regret that the only way the State provides
manual training for its young men is through the passport
and credentials of crime.</p>

<h4>THE HABIT OF LABOR</h4>

<p>It is not so necessary that a convict shall know a trade, in
these days of machinery and constant and continual changes in
the methods of manufacture, as it is that he shall have developed
in him habits of industry and the willingness to work at what he
can do. The great trouble with the average convict is, that he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
not only does not know a trade, but that he has not been drilled
in any kind of labor, and prefers to obtain his substance from the
labor of others, by surreptitious, unlawful and unjust means.
The <i>habit</i> of labor is what he needs more than the specific kind
of work.</p>

<p>As Superintendent Brockway said many years ago: “Only
motivelessness is the seat of incorrigibility. To discover or
create a want is to find a motive. Given a motive, you may direct
a habit. To form a habit is to create character. Habit is
the school of conscience. Conscience and habit reinforce one
another.”</p>

<p>Let us have the <i>habit</i> of labor rather than the expensive
training in trades, which in countless thousands of great industrial
establishments will be of no additional value.</p>

<h4>LITERARY DISCIPLINE</h4>

<p>Next to education in labor, I place as the most important
factor in prison discipline the development of the mind through
the medium of the various agencies that may be employed for
that purpose, not forgetting that labor develops the mind as well
as the muscle.</p>

<p>An overwhelming majority of the inmates of any prison
are densely and grossly ignorant, and mentally deficient. The
polished, scholarly, shrewd criminal is a creature of fiction, not
of fact, the exception, not the rule. The average convict is a
living example of Horace Mann’s aphorism, that “ignorance
in this country is a crime.”</p>

<h4>THE PRISON SCHOOL</h4>

<p>The convict’s mental discipline can be accomplished in
many ways, one of which should be the prison school. The
work here will often have to be of the most elementary character.
This work should not be merely perfunctory, but should
have the most careful attention and consideration. The eagerness
with which even comparatively old men undertake to
master the simplest primer is one of the pathetic but encouraging
aspects of prison-school life.</p>

<p>As the school will probably have to be an evening school
of but few hours’ duration, the course of study will necessarily
have to be comparatively brief, in order that all inmates needing
its help may have their turn.</p>

<p>But the brief term in school should be supplemented by a
course of reading and study in the cells, or elsewhere, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
should have the same attention, the same systematic oversight
and encouragement that the work in the school had. This
serves a twofold purpose: first, to drill and discipline the minds,
furnish them with concrete information; and second, to fulfill a
vital necessity in proper prison discipline, the continual occupation
of the subject in his waking hours, with labor, study or
proper recreation.</p>

<p>The writer recalls reading recently with some curiosity and
interest a stricture written some nineteen years ago on the
methods of the Elmira Reformatory referring to the study in
the cells of “The Prologue of the Canterbury Tales,” “The
Tragedy of Hamlet,” Emerson’s “May Day,” Browning’s
“Paracelsus,” and similar literature, and the critic stated that if
the convicts are to remain in prison for life, there can be no objection
to such reading, but otherwise, the time thus occupied
is worse than wasted.</p>

<p>But there is where the critic is wofully mistaken. No
man can read even such classics as are here named without
being substantially and materially benefited and strengthened,
and better able to cope with the practical bread-and-butter part
of life. This statement may seem far-fetched, but it is true.</p>

<p>But he does not need to be confined to such books. In this
intensely practical age, books are as practical as other things.
In the institution over which I preside, scores of men are taking
courses in the correspondence schools, doing well, and neglecting
no prison requirements. Let the library be stocked with
practical handbooks that tell men how to do things, such as to
mix concrete, lay brick, build houses, construct telephone lines,
run machinery, and similar enterprises.</p>

<p>Prison libraries are generally the result of heterogeneous
and indiscriminate donations, the aftermath of the spring house-cleanings
of the philanthropically inclined. Such donations
should be accepted in the spirit in which given, graciously,
thankfully, then where proper, classified, catalogued and used.
But this source should not be depended on entirely, or even
largely, to supply the library. The books should be selected
with as much care and fidelity as they are selected for a university
or a public library, for they are to accomplish the same
purpose.</p>

<h4>THE DAILY AND WEEKLY NEWSPAPER</h4>

<p>The writer never shared in the fear of the daily or weekly
newspaper in the prison. He acknowledges their necessity to
himself, and feels that what is helpful to him ought not seriously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
to injure his men. In this day, the yellow journals, so called,
are mighty agencies for reform, and they and their associate
muck rakers, the magazines, are uncovering frauds and wrongs
in high places, and driving powerful wrongdoers to cover; and
when their work is completed, the smaller criminals will not
have the baleful example of some people in high places to justify
them in their evil ways. The taste for a blood-and-thunder
paper, magazine or book, is infinitely preferable to none at all.
The taste will pall eventually on such pabulum and call for
better.</p>

<p>Every prison is a community of itself and to itself. The
things that elevate people outside, should be found inside the
walls. There should be neatness and cleanliness and sanitary
conditions everywhere. The lawns should be green, neat and
carefully kept. Every prison should have a greenhouse, and
flowers should abound in profusion, for civilizing, ennobling
and disciplinary powers of nature at her fairest cannot be over-estimated.</p>

<p>The reading courses should be supplemented by instructive
lectures and literary entertainments, for such times as are
practicable. Theatricals should be permitted and encouraged
at intervals. Such relaxation is a great lubricant. Quartettes,
octettes and choirs should be organized, and all the men possible
taught vocal music under a competent instructor. Orchestras
and brass bands should be maintained from the inmates, and
music should be a feature of very proper occasion.</p>

<p>To the timid soul who fears that all these pains will pamper
the convict and make him love the prison and do something to
be returned, let me say that the greatest punishment is in being
immured behind great walls beyond which he cannot go, and
any deprivation of the elements of reform and enlightened discipline
is a mere bagatelle compared to the main fact of imprisonment.
As Chaplain Tribou forcibly says: “Men are not
sent to prison to be punished, they are punished by being sent
to prison.”</p>

<p>Let the great aim be to show the men the many legitimate
avenues of improvement, enlightenment, enjoyment and amusements
that are open to those who never transgress the law.</p>

<p>Convicts are not to be classed as a peculiar species of genus
homo, but are to be regarded as <i>individuals</i>, amenable to the
same influences, the same treatment, the same hopes as other
men. Charles Reade, in his famous book “It Is Never Too Late
to Mend,” tells of two little children who come to see a thief just
arrested. “Farmer Fielding,” says the little girl, courtesying,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
a mode of reverence which was instantly copied by the boy,
“we are come to see the thief; they say you have caught one.”
“Oh dear!” and her bright little countenance was overcast,
“I couldn’t have told it from a man.”</p>

<p>Prison sentiment is a powerful auxiliary in discipline, and
the consciousness among the men that “a square deal” from the
management can be depended upon for the cause of enlightenment,
refinement, cheer and relaxation, is worth more than a
regiment of soldiers.</p>

<h4>RELIGION AS A FACTOR</h4>

<p>Religion ought to be a mighty factor in correct prison discipline.
If <i>good</i> men need religion to help them and sustain
them, certainly <i>bad</i> men need it far more. This department of
discipline should be presided over and directed by a strong,
level-headed, pious God-fearing man, who may have at once the
confidence of the warden and his subordinates, and the inmates
as well, a very difficult undertaking.</p>

<p>A chaplain who mistakes his mission and attends to matters
not within his province, can tear up and destroy the discipline
of a prison more quickly and effectively than anyone else in it.
But his opportunities for good are as great as, or greater than,
for evil, and if he can discern between those who desire real
spiritual consolation and those who are after the loaves and
fishes, between spiritual pardon and official clemency, and devote
himself unreservedly to the one and resolutely eschew the
other, no man can overestimate his value.</p>

<p>The warden and the chaplain should go hand in hand, each
sustaining the other. They need to have a perfect understanding,
neither mistrusting the other. And with such an understanding,
let the chaplain have entire charge of his church and
other spiritual services, and resolutely exclude the self-constituted
evangelist, the chance visitor, and forbid absolutely the
spectacular and highly emotional harangues of people utterly
unacquainted with the population with which they seek to deal.
In nothing should there be more rigid censorship and more
careful espionage than in the chapel and other religious services.</p>

<p>To quote from an address made by me before the National
Prison Association in Louisville in 1903: “The influence of
sightseers and idle visitors to prisons, always bad, reaches the
acme of its perniciousness in the chapel service, if unrestrained
and unguided by prison officials of experience and firmness, who
alone are in a position to know that sickly sentimentalism is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
worst possible pabulum to offer men already too eager to justify
their evil deeds.”</p>

<h4>THE DISCIPLINE OF OFFICERS</h4>

<p>The question at once comes up, how are all these elements
of discipline to be arranged for in a prison. Who are to provide
and arrange for them?</p>

<p>This is altogether the most difficult question to answer.
The most careful and exacting discipline is not for the <i>convict</i>,
but for the <i>officials</i> of a prison.</p>

<p>If convicts are to be gradually educated and turned from
crime into virtue, out of slothfulness and viciousness into habits
of industry, thrift, sobriety, regularity and evenness of life, it
must be through the agency of officers, themselves disciplined,
educated and schooled in self-control. “No man is fit to command
who has not first learned to obey.”</p>

<p>No man can hope to have zeal, skill and care, the patience
and fidelity to bring up men from the depths of ignorance to the
level of intelligence, who has not himself gone over a part of the
road. “Such officers are not found.” “They must be taught
and trained.”</p>

<p>Superintendent Brockway has said: “The warden of a
prison receives into his charge with the bodily presence of the
prisoners, their very soul life, and is clothed with the authority
and the duty to develop that life for fullness and perfection.
He who enters upon the work of soul culture, touches the life
and forces of a mysterious realm. His attitude should be profoundly
reverent, for he invades a sacred precinct.”</p>

<p>This being the case, nothing but high grade, intelligent,
educated men, should be permitted to have charge of this soul
life. It is absurd to hope that any other can administer the
discipline necessary to build up men whom society has failed
or neglected to cultivate.</p>

<p>Every employé of a prison should be a man of good appearance,
no physical blemishes, a man of high character, and
should possess at least a good English education and be a
student.</p>

<p>In many States, only those who have certain views upon
the tariff and finance, or who are supposed to have, are permitted
to have positions as officers in the prisons. But even
there, a schedule of requirements within that limit may be
arranged for, and rigidly adhered to. There ought to be an
age limit, height, and other physical requirements, and an educational
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
test. A mere recommendation from a politician, however
high, is usually not worth the paper upon which it is
written, chiefly because the aforesaid politician has only the most
vague idea of the actual requirements of the prison official,
and is under the impression that anybody who can occupy space
will do.</p>

<p>There ought to be a school for the preparation of persons
for institutional work. Such a school should be a national one
and would be immensely profitable in the increased reformatory
results in prisons, the saving of many insane from helpless insanity,
and the reclaiming of many dependents.</p>

<p>With crime costing $300,000,000 a year, and every criminal
saved worth a least $1,600 a year to the nation, the necessity
for such a school for training specialists is very great.</p>

<h4>DRILLING OF NEW OFFICERS</h4>

<p>The evolution of a new guard is one of the interesting, but
soul-trying experiences of every prison warden. Perhaps the
warden, before assigning the new man to duty, talks to him,
admonishing him as to his procedure, and aiming to tell him of
the pitfalls that experience has pointed out. But he talks “to
ears that hear not.” He closes his first interview by handing
the new man a book of rules for his perusal. But they are given
“to eyes that see not.” That book of rules is the result of the
experience, the mistakes, the observations, the failures and the
successes of generations of prison officials, and can no more
be fathomed by a new guard at once, than can the Constitution
of the United States, upon first reading, be comprehended by
one of Upton Sinclair’s Lithuanians on his journey to the
Chicago stockyards.</p>

<p>Under the present system, that guard must learn largely by
mortifying experiences, the commission of serious mistakes,
alike costly to the institution and its wards.</p>

<p>While there are no general schools for the preparation of
officers for institutional work (the School of Philanthropy of
New York possibly excepted), yet there may be organized in
every prison a school for the education and development of
officers, and this should be done. Let there be a definite course
of reading and study arranged for officers by the superintendent,
and have frequent examinations and discussions bearing
on prison problems.</p>

<p>Fortunately our literature is rich in books worthy the most
careful study and research. There is Prof. Henderson’s admirable
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
text book on “Dependents, Defectives and Delinquents;”
Dr. E. C. Wines on “The State of Prisons and Child Saving
Institutions,” the many valuable contributions of Rev. S. J.
Barrows, Superintendent Brockway, Joseph F. Scott, Frank
L. Randall, Revs. August Drahms, F. H. Wines, A. McDonald,
Beccaria and Howard, Lombroso and Dugdale, Eugene Smith
and Charlton T. Lewis and scores of others.</p>

<p>Charles Reade’s great muck-rake book “It Is Never Too
Late to Mend,” which drove the separate and silent system out
of England, deserves the most careful study and thought.
Victor Hugo’s valued “Les Miserables” cannot be read too carefully
or critically. Dickens’ “American Notes” gives a most
graphic account of the separate system, and his “Pickwick
Papers” portray most powerfully the debtor’s jail.</p>

<p>Every report of the National Prison Association and the
Conference of Charities and Correction, replete as they are
with invaluable discussions of vital topics, should be read by
every prison official, as well also as the different annual or
biennial reports issued by the different institutions throughout
the country, which contain points of inestimable value on conducting
prisons.</p>

<p>In one of the offices of the model prisons of this country
is a great round table capable of accommodating thirty or
forty people. Around this table at intervals officers are seated
to listen to lectures and hear and participate in discussions
upon approved methods of accomplishing the best work. This
might well be emulated in every similar institution.</p>

<p>There should be a fund set aside in every institution to
defray the expenses of a number of officials, annually to visit
other institutions for the purpose of observing how the work
is done elsewhere, and thus by actual contact to obtain the
most approved methods. And this ought not to be confined
to the heads of departments alone, but should be open to even
the humblest official in his turn. In addition to its practical
value, it makes him realize that his work is a profession not
to be despised or made light of, and that the curing of moral
ailments, the helping of those who cannot help themselves, is
a grand and a glorious calling, exceeded in its value to the
world by no other.</p>

<h4>THE OFFICERS’ SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS</h4>

<p>When the day’s work is done officers should ordinarily
leave the institution and its incidents behind them. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
should participate actively and zealously in the outside social
and religious matters of the community in which they are
located. This balances them and gives them tone, and prevents
pessimism, which may otherwise control them.</p>

<p>An officer’s usefulness is measured by the amount of good
influence he exerts upon those under his charge. But every
warden has at times the melancholy experience of observing
that instead of some officers elevating and uplifting their men
by their examples, the convicts’ influence has become the
greater, and the officer’s ideals are gradually shattered, his resiliency
lost, and his influence vanished. It is to guard against
this melancholy possibility that officers should be urged to cultivate
the best part of outside social, moral, and religious life.</p>

<p>All of the progress and reform that has occurred in penal
legislation, prison rules, and procedure has come as a result
of the study, care, thought, and efforts of prison officials and
students of penology.</p>

<p>All the legislation that has taken away from prisons the
gospel of labor, that has robbed them of the full opportunity
of doing what was intended for them, has come largely as a
result of the cowardice or lack of energy of prison officials
who have not stood up against the unreasonable, unrighteous
demands of thoughtless labor agitators, or who have not in
time remedied and improved their labor systems and conditions
so they might escape just criticism.</p>

<p>If there is a bad prison law on any statute book, or if a
good one needs to be placed there, zealous, informed prison
officials should never cease agitation until the defect is remedied.
These reforms will come from no other source.</p>

<p>In this strenuous age the people have shown that they
desire to do the right thing if the way be pointed out, and the
age is ripe for reforms in prison laws and customs as it is in
all other lines.</p>

<p>All those who have to deal with offenders of the law
should be brought in touch with one another. Judges and district
or prosecuting attorneys should be required, as part of
their duties, to visit the institutions which house the men sent
there through their efforts, and should know the conditions
and be in a position to offer and receive suggestions.</p>

<p>Whenever a likely man, once discharged, reënters a prison,
let the thoughtful warden not ask, “What did this man to be
returned?” but rather let him inquire: “What did I fail to
do? Where is my institution defective? What precaution
did society fail to take that this man fell again?”

<p>Precepts count for <i>something</i> in prison and elsewhere.
Example counts for almost <i>everything</i>. We proceed not from
the abstract to the concrete in our daily lives. To-day the
eyes of America are turned upon our strenuous president, not
for precept, but for example; strenuous in his sports, therefore
everybody becomes athletic; strenuous in literature, and
all America reads; strenuous in the enforcement of the law
and a “square deal” for every man, and the whole nation emulates
his example and takes on a new lease of civic righteousness.</p>

<p>As Napoleon rode at the head of his legions through
Egypt, past the pyramids, he halted, and in an impassioned
address he said, “Soldiers, from the summits of these pyramids
forty centuries look down upon you.”</p>

<p>But the modern warden, within his castled home, environed
by frowning walls, at the head of his scores of officers
and superintendents of departments, may say, “Officers, from
these depths of crime, misery, degradation, and despair hundreds
of imprisoned souls look up to you for example, for inspiration,
for guidance, and for help.”</p>

<p>And as officers thus receive the message and the tacit
command may each resolve that his heart shall be so moved,
his mind be so cultivated, strengthened and disciplined, and
his actions be so guarded and guided, that the pathetic call
thus made by those below him shall not be made in vain.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
